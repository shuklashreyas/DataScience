    "The `ipynb` format stores outputs from the last time you ran the notebook.  (When you open a notebook it has the figures and outputs of the last time you ran it too).

Pop into office hours or DM us in MS Teams if you have a specific question about your work or if you would like another pair of eyes or talk through your code.\n",

For more information, read the following article [How to Write Beautiful Python Code With PEP 8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/) or ask your TA's for tips.\n",

    "The data clearly demonstrates a pattern linking lower birth weights to both hypertension and smoking. The moms who did not smoke or have a history of hypertension gave birth to babies with the highest average birth weight—3090.44 grams—with the lowest weight at 1021.00 grams and the highest weight at 4990.00 grams. On the other hand, kids born to smokers had an average birth weight of 2771.92 grams, with a range of 709.00 to 4238.00 grams. The average birth weight of babies born to moms with hypertension was 2536.83 grams, with a range of 1135.00 to 3790.00 grams. With an average birth weight of 2561.00 grams, babies delivered to moms who smoked and had hypertension were the most affected group. According to these results, birth weight is impacted negatively by smoking and hypertension, and birth weights that are healthy are linked to the absence of these risk factors."
